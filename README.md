# Sidewalk Agent-Based Simulation for Analyzing the Impact of Social Distancing on Infection Spread in a Population
This project involved the development of an agent-based simulation model to analyze the impact of social distancing on the spread of infection in a population. Using agent-based modeling techniques, the simulation was able to track infection rates over time as agents practiced varying degrees of social distancing.

The simulation showed that increasing social distancing compliance could significantly reduce the spread of infection over time. The insights gained from this project can help inform public health policy decisions in the future.
